                            <b>Stan Lee</b> was an American comic book writer, editor, publisher, and producer.He rose through the ranks of a family-run business called <u>Timely Comics</u> which would later become <u>Marvel Comics</u>.

                            In collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly co-writers/artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko—he co-created iconic characters, including <u>superheroes</u> <u>Spider-Man</u>, <u>the X-Men</u>, <u>Iron Man</u>, <u>Thor</u>, <u>the Hulk</u>, <u>Ant-Man</u>, <u>the Wasp</u>, <u>the Fantastic Four</u>, <u>Black Panther</u>, <u>Daredevil</u>, <u>Doctor Strange</u>, <u>the Scarlet Witch</u>, and <u>Black Widow</u>. These and other characters' introductions in the 1960s pioneered a more naturalistic approach in superhero comics, and in the 1970s Lee challenged the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to changes in its policies. In the 1980s he pursued the development of Marvel properties in other media, with mixed results.
